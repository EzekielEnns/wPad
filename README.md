# wPad
the goal is to make a very small rich text editor lib compatible with react
- [inspired by swappy](https://swapy.tahazsh.com/)
- [motivated by how beastly/annoying lexical is](https://lexical.dev/)

### current state
rnd, experimenting with ways to have content editable in react/vs vanilla
exploring using wasm as a state management  but might be over kill


### target outcomes
- node insertion react accessible
- react node insertion with contenteditable="false"
- undo and redo access
- export state as file/blob
- small size aiming for anything less then 4.5kb
